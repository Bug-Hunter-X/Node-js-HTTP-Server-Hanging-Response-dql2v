# Node.js HTTP Server Hanging Response

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js HTTP servers where a response hangs because the `content-length` header is missing and `res.end()` is not called. This can lead to clients experiencing delays or timeouts while waiting for a complete response.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The server sends a response but fails to signal the end, causing the client to hang.  The missing `content-length` header exacerbates the problem, as the client may not know how much data to expect.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code. The solution involves setting the `content-length` header explicitly and calling `res.end()` to properly signal the end of the response. This ensures that clients receive a complete and timely response.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`
3. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000` in your browser or using a tool like `curl`. You will likely see a hanging response.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`
5. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000` again.  You will see a complete response.

This example highlights the importance of proper HTTP response handling in Node.js applications to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure reliable client communication.
